IntelliJ/Android Studio plugin for running and managing [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and adb devices (USB & WiFi both)

## Why
I am an Android Developer myself and I always use scrcpy ❤ to test my work on my phone.I feel lazy to launch scrcpy from terminal everytime. So I thought why not make a plugin for this so it would help all the Android
 Developers!

## Exclusive Features
- One Click to switch USB Device to WiFi
- Run scrcpy on multiple devices effortlessly
- Disconnect WiFi Devices
- Connect WiFi Devices
- All options from [scrcpy v1.17](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) are configurable from the UI
- Quick *Shortcuts* button for you to remember scrcpy shortcuts
- Easy installation, scrcpy does not need to be added in your system's PATH Variable
- *Shortcuts* are directly loaded from scrcpy's GitHub README if you are connected to the internet, else static shortcuts are loaded from scrcpy v1.16
- (macOS) automatically hide / show scrcpy windows  when sidebar tool is collapsed / expanded

## Requirements
1. Works on Android Studio 4.0+ and other IntelliJ-based IDEs with build number `193.4099.13` and above 
2. `adb` and `scrcpy` installed (need not be configured in `PATH`)

## Installation
Install the plugin in Android Studio/IntelliJ-based IDE via:
#### [JetBrains Plugins Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14565-scrcpy)
   - Search for 'scrcpy Controller', install, and restart IDE

#### Manually
   - Download latest plugin zip (should contain latest version in file name e.g. 0.1.0) from [releases](https://github.com/shripal17/ScrcpyController/releases/latest)
   - From Android Studio/IntelliJ-based IDE, open Settings -> Plugins -> Settings Icon -> Install plugin from disk and select the downloaded plugin zip -> Restart IDE
1. Download and extract [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) to any folder of your choice
2. Go to IDE Settings -> Tools -> Scrcpy Controller -> Enter/choose the location of the previously extracted scrcpy release -> Click on *Test* button to verify selected/entered path -> *Ok* button

## Bonus
- All options visible in the UI excluding the devices table (obviously) persist their values across IDE Restarts!
- The `To WiFi` button will automatically try to switch your USB-connected device to WiFi adb by:
    1. Restarting adbd in tcpip mode (uses the port entered in `ADB WiFi` section or `5555` (default))
    2. Extract device's local WiFi IP and run's `adb connect` on the extracted IP
- You can configure advanced, rarely-used options for scrcpy from IDE Settings -> Tools -> Scrcpy Controller
- Devices with `scrcpy` currently running have a `•` added to their serial

- This repository follows Google (2-space indents) coding style, so please keep this in mind while making PRs

## Known Issues
- If you use the plugin's stop button to terminate an active scrcpy recording session with `mp4` extension, the `mp4` file is not playable. This is being caused by Java's `Process` not interrupting scrcpy session
 properly. Similar issue exists with `mkv` extension, although the `mkv` file can be played properly, it is not seekable.<br>
 Workaround: Close the scrcpy session with the window's close button
- [jadb](https://github.com/vidstige/jadb) throws an exception if any connected device becomes offline, hence devices list is not refreshed

## Roadmap
- [ ] Provide better UI/UX
- [ ] Add support for [sndcpy](https://github.com/rom1v/sndcpy)
- [ ] Check and install `scrcpy` updates
